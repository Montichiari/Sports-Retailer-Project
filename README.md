# Sports Retailer Data Analysis Project
In this project, data of transactions over 6 months from a household-name Sports Retailer in Singapore was explored and analysed for insights on the behavior and age demographics of customers. This included average basket size and value of members vs non-members, member's preferred shopping channels, total number of transactions and sales for each store, and popular timings for purchases in-store. Lastly, market basket analysis was done to find frequently bought combinations of items, often used to identify products to cross-sell, or in-store product placement.

First, the data was loaded into <b>PostgreSQL</b> and <b>SQL</b> was used to perform data cleaning and to join tables, before queries were written to find out more about number of transactions made by each age demographic.

For further data analysis, <b>Python</b> was used to find:<br>
i) Average basket size and average basket value of members and non-members per store. <br>
ii) Percentage of members who shopped at different channels, broken down into various combinations. <br>
iii) Total number of transactions and sales by store over the 6 month period. <br>
iv) Timings of the day that were most popular for in-store purchases.
<br>

Finally, the Apriori algorithm was applied using a random sample of 30,000 transactions from two of the sales channels in order to find item combinations that are frequently bought together.
