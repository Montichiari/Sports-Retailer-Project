# Sports-Retailer-Project
In this project, data from a household-name Sports Retailer in Singapore was analysed in order to uncover insights on consumer's behavior/demographics based on age, favourite stores and types of stores, average basket value, member vs non-member, and more. 

First, the data was loaded into <b>PostgreSQL</b> and <b>SQL</b> was used to perform data cleaning and to join tables, before queries were written to find out more about number of transactions made by each age demographic.

For further data analysis, <b>Python</b> was used to uncover:<br>
i) Average basket size and average basket value of members and non-members per store. <br>
ii) Percentage of members who shopped at different channels, broken down into various combinations. <br>
iii) Timings of the day that were most popular for in-store purchases.
